#### Description:
HELLO CS50 this is my final project and its name is Rentals. The app idea came to me when when Me and grandfather where going to collect the money form our tenant and what I saw was that we write writing the records of our tenant in small diary, and some time this diary was lost, misplaced or out of the pages so it was very annoying each time. So then I thought let make it digital so it will be easy to store data and we have to not to worry about to buy a new diary each time. So This app is made with Flask and sqlachemy So in this app has Three Tap first New tenant, OLd tenant and Remove tenant. Firslty let us talk about New tenant what happening in new tenant tap so in new tenant route you have four inpur fiels first the username, Phone Number , Electric bill and lastely the monthly rent so user will provide with the details like tenant name its phone number its electric bill and its monthly rent and user will hit enter it will redirect to the homepage where the all the details of the tenant will be shown to the user. Now user can add multiple tenant and user can see the details of the tenant on the homepage. Secondly let talk about Old tenant tab So when user click on this tab user will be input field like following option tab to select the registered tenant, input field to add new Electric bill, input field to new monthly rent, input field to add Electic bill to paid by tenant and lastly a input field to add monthly rent paid by tenant so now user can fill all these details like selecting different tenant addding its new electric bill and new rent and you also add the details like if the user paid the rent and electric bill of the previous month and when user will hit enter button it will redirect to the homepage will the details of that tenant will be updated. Lastely the Remove tenant tab when user click on this tab user will be see the option menu where user can select the tenant so when user will hit the enter key the tenant the user has selected will be delete like for some reason the tenanat what to leave the place so when you will see the homepage you will find that the tenant has been remove from the homepage.
